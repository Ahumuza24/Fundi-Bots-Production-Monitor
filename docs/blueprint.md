## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#DD3333) to evoke professionalism, trust, and stability, reflecting the reliability required in manufacturing.
- Background color: Light Gray (#f0f2f5), provides a neutral, clean backdrop for content, ensuring legibility and reducing visual fatigue.
- Accent color: Teal (##F58320) for interactive elements and key notifications, standing out against the neutral background to draw attention to important actions and updates.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body text; known for its clarity and readability in digital interfaces; promotes a clean and modern aesthetic for optimal user experience.
- Use a set of consistent, professional icons from a library such as FontAwesome or Material Icons. Icons should be minimalistic and easily recognizable, enhancing navigation and visual communication within the app.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout for a structured and efficient presentation of information. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment, use clear section divisions to facilitate easy navigation and data interpretation.
- Integrate smooth, subtle transitions and animations using Framer Motion to enhance user experience without being distracting. Loading states, confirmations, and UI element transitions should be animated to provide feedback and create a more engaging interface.
