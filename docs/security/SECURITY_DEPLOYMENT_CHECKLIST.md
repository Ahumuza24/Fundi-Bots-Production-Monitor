# Security Deployment Checklist

## üîí Pre-Deployment Security Setup

### 1. Firestore Security Rules Deployment

```bash
# Deploy the new security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy indexes (if updated)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:rules get
```

### 2. Initial Admin User Setup

**Option A: Using Setup Script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Firebase Admin SDK
npm install firebase-admin

# Set up service account credentials
# Download service account key from Firebase Console
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account-key.json"

# Run admin setup script
npm run setup:admin
```

**Option B: Manual Setup via Firebase Console**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication
2. Add user manually
3. Go to Firestore ‚Üí users collection
4. Create document with user's UID:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Admin Name",
     "email": "admin@example.com",
     "role": "admin",
     "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

### 3. Security Validation

```bash
# Validate security rules are working
npm run validate:security

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Tests Passed: 3
# ‚ùå Tests Failed: 0
# üéâ All security tests passed!
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Rules Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Admin: Full access to all collections
  - Assembler: Limited access based on assignments
  - Unauthenticated: No access

- **Data Validation**
  - Required field validation
  - Type checking (string, timestamp, etc.)
  - Enum validation (status, role fields)
  - Business rule enforcement

- **Ownership Controls**
  - Users can only access their own data
  - Project assignment validation
  - Work session ownership checks

- **Audit Trail**
  - Immutable audit logs
  - Admin-only access to system logs
  - User action tracking

- **Field-Level Security**
  - Users can only update specific fields
  - Role changes require admin privileges
  - Sensitive data protection

## üîê Collection Security Summary

| Collection | Admin Access | User Access | Validation |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `users` | Full CRUD | Own profile only | Role, email, name required |
| `projects` | Full CRUD | Assigned projects only | Status enum, required fields |
| `workers` | Full CRUD | Own profile (limited) | Role validation |
| `work-sessions` | Full CRUD | Own sessions only | Worker ID validation |
| `notifications` | Full CRUD | Own notifications only | Type enum validation |
| `reports` | Full CRUD | Read assigned only | Admin-only write |
| `system-logs` | Full CRUD | No access | Admin-only |
| `audit-trail` | Read only | No access | Immutable |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### 1. First Admin User
- **Critical**: Create the first admin user immediately after deploying rules
- Without an admin user, you may be locked out of the system
- Use the setup script or Firebase Console method above

### 2. Role Management
- Only admins can change user roles
- Role changes are validated in security rules
- Users cannot elevate their own privileges

### 3. Data Migration
- Existing data must comply with new validation rules
- Run data cleanup before deploying strict rules
- Test with sample data first

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Rules with `get()` calls may impact performance
- Monitor Firestore usage after deployment
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data

## üß™ Testing Security Rules

### Local Testing with Firebase Emulator

```bash
# Start Firestore emulator
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Run your app against emulator
# Test different user roles and permissions
```

### Production Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can create/read/update/delete all collections
- [ ] Assemblers can only access assigned projects
- [ ] Users cannot access other users' data
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are denied access
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid documents
- [ ] Audit trail is immutable
- [ ] System logs are admin-only

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Locked Out of System

1. **Firebase Console Access**
   - Use Firebase Console to manually update user roles
   - Go to Firestore ‚Üí users collection
   - Update user document to set `role: "admin"`

2. **Firebase Admin SDK**
   - Use server-side Admin SDK with service account
   - Bypass security rules with admin privileges
   - Update user roles programmatically

3. **Temporary Rule Relaxation**
   - Deploy temporary permissive rules
   - Fix user roles
   - Redeploy secure rules

### Emergency Rule Deployment

```bash
# Deploy emergency permissive rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Fix user roles/data issues

# Redeploy secure rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Audits

- [ ] Review Firestore usage patterns
- [ ] Check for unusual access patterns
- [ ] Validate user roles are correct
- [ ] Review audit trail for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update rules as business requirements change

### Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor Firestore read/write operations
- [ ] Check rule evaluation performance
- [ ] Optimize rules if needed
- [ ] Review billing for unexpected usage

## üîÑ Rule Update Process

1. **Test in Development**
   - Update rules in development environment
   - Test with Firebase emulator
   - Validate all user scenarios

2. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Validate with real data

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy during low-traffic period
   - Monitor for errors immediately
   - Have rollback plan ready

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Run security validation script
   - Test critical user flows
   - Monitor error logs

## ‚úÖ Deployment Completion Checklist

- [ ] Firestore security rules deployed
- [ ] Initial admin user created
- [ ] Security validation tests pass
- [ ] All user roles configured correctly
- [ ] Audit trail functioning
- [ ] System logs accessible to admins only
- [ ] Data validation working correctly
- [ ] Performance monitoring in place
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Team trained on new security model
